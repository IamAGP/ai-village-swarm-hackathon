# Tracer evaluation

How much should you trust an edge the tracer draws? Measured on stratified, blind-labelled samples.

## Method

1. `explorer/label_sample.py <seed>` draws a seeded, stratified sample of exposure edges
   (25 `explicit`, 25 `temporal`, 15 `none`; adopter channel ∈ chat / action / model_output; noise excluded),
   with ±400-char excerpts of the source post and the adopter's first use around the URL.
2. The sample is shuffled and **blinded**: the evidence level, lag and row ids are removed; an answer key is
   kept separately.
3. An independent annotator (a separate Claude agent, instructed not to open the key) labels each item:
   - with a source post: did the adopter plausibly get the URL from this source? `yes / plausible / no / unclear`
   - without one: does the adopter's text show it received the URL from someone? `yes / no / unclear`
4. Precision per evidence level = labelled-correct / decided (unclear excluded); *strict* counts `yes` only,
   *lenient* counts `yes + plausible`. For `none`, the miss rate = `yes` / decided.

**Caveats.** Labels are model-made, not human; a human spot-check is pending. Samples are small, so the
intervals are wide (Wilson 95% CIs below). Excerpts are ±400 chars; some attributions sit outside them
(→ `unclear`).

## Results

### Tracer v2 — source = most recent prior chat poster (sample seed 3, 2026-09-26)

| evidence | n | yes | plausible | no | unclear | precision strict | lenient |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| explicit | 25 | 18 | 5 | 0 | 2 | 78% (18/23) | 100% (23/23) |
| temporal | 25 | 8 | 11 | 3 | 3 | 36% (8/22) | 86% (19/22) |
| none | 15 | 0 | – | 9 | 6 | misses: 0/9 | |

All 3 `no` labels were **misattributions**: the adopter's text credits a different agent that had also posted
the URL earlier, but v2 picked the *most recent* poster. → v3 picks, among all prior posters, the most recent
one the adopter names; otherwise the most recent poster.

### Tracer v3 — named poster preferred (held-out sample seed 777, 2026-09-26)

Fresh sample (0 overlap with seed 3), labelled blind by **two** annotators (A = the v2 annotator, B = new).

| evidence | annotator | yes | plausible | no | unclear | precision strict | lenient |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| explicit | A | 15 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 60% [41–77%] | 100% [87–100%] |
| explicit | B | 14 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 56% [37–73%] | 100% [87–100%] |
| temporal | A | 10 | 15 | 0 | 0 | 40% [23–59%] | 100% [87–100%] |
| temporal | B | 8 | 17 | 0 | 0 | 32% [17–52%] | 100% [87–100%] |
| none (misses) | A / B | 0 / 0 | – | 10 / 12 | 5 / 3 | misses 0/10 [0–28%] · 0/12 [0–24%] | |

**Agreement A vs B:** 58/65 exact (89%), Cohen's κ = 0.84; on the 50 sourced items the lenient
"correct?" call agrees 50/50. Disagreements are yes↔plausible (3) and no↔unclear (4) — never correct↔wrong.

### Summary

- v3 removed the only failure mode seen: **0 wrong edges in 50 held-out sourced edges under both annotators**
  (v2: 3/44). Sourced edges are right-or-plausible essentially always (lenient ≥ 87% lower CI bound).
- **Strict** precision — the edge text *shows* the exposure — is ~56–60% for `explicit` and ~32–40% for
  `temporal` on held-out data. v2's 78% came from a friendlier sample (same annotator A: 78% → 60%).
- `none` edges: no confirmed missed exposure in 22 decided held-out items (upper CI ≈ 24–28%).
- Treat `temporal` as "consistent with exposure", not proof; `explicit` as the adopter naming the source.
