# Tracer evaluation

How much should you trust an edge the tracer draws? Measured on stratified, blind-labelled samples.

## Method

1. `explorer/label_sample.py <seed>` draws a seeded, stratified sample of exposure edges
   (25 `explicit`, 25 `temporal`, 15 `none`; adopter channel ∈ chat / action / model_output; noise excluded),
   with ±400-char excerpts of the source post and the adopter's first use around the URL.
2. The sample is shuffled and **blinded**: the evidence level, lag and row ids are removed; an answer key is
   kept separately.
3. An independent annotator (a separate Claude agent, instructed not to open the key) labels each item:
   - with a source post: did the adopter plausibly get the URL from this source? `yes / plausible / no / unclear`
   - without one: does the adopter's text show it received the URL from someone? `yes / no / unclear`
4. Precision per evidence level = labelled-correct / decided (unclear excluded); *strict* counts `yes` only,
   *lenient* counts `yes + plausible`. For `none`, the miss rate = `yes` / decided.

**Caveats.** Labels are model-made, not human; a human spot-check is pending. Samples are small, so the
intervals are wide (Wilson 95% CIs below). Excerpts are ±400 chars; some attributions sit outside them
(→ `unclear`).

The results below were measured before room visibility filtering. The updated tracer can mark an edge
`cross_room` or retain a source with `room_unknown`; these categories need a fresh blind evaluation before
their accuracy is reported.

### Self-discovery guard (#17, 2026-10-01)

`explicit` now means the first-use text names the selected source **and no self-discovery cue was
detected**. `self_found` is a heuristic flag, not proof of independent discovery. The inspectable
`self_found_cues` list records which rule fired: a specific whole-turn plan to find links and search,
first-person web search/lookup near the URL, or an ownership/creation phrase directly introducing it.
Generic browsing, negations, and searching a supplied page for errors do not suffice. The rules operate
on the existing normalised text; they cannot reliably distinguish quoted speech, an unrelated nearby
URL, or hypothetical plans from completed actions. URL-local rules use the first matching URL occurrence
and can miss narrative elsewhere in a long turn or a differently spelled URL.

Affected named edges become `temporal` at ≤72 h or `stale` beyond 72 h. Source selection and row IDs are
preserved: these remain candidate exposures, not newly established discovery routes. `source_named`
keeps the original name-match signal. `named_old` flags named sources older than 72 h; age alone does
not downgrade them, because an old but explicitly acknowledged source can still be valid.

An initial 400-character ownership rule incorrectly matched four different-project/channel-list
mentions. Those development cases were inspected and the rule tightened to direct URL introduction;
they are not held-out evaluation. Synthetic regressions cover these confounds. The data comparison and
blinded changed/control set are reproducible with `explorer/compare_self_discovery.py`; samples contain
full source posts and first-use turns, so accuracy is not directly comparable to the older ±400-character
excerpts. A changed-edge sample assesses downgrade decisions, not recall of all self-discovered URLs.
No precision improvement is claimed until independent annotation (and ideally human review).

Measured against v6 on export `838b415`: 73,578 edges before/after, with zero source-row or target-row
changes. `explicit` 3,519 → 3,518; `temporal` 32,461 → 32,462; `mention` 3,520, `stale` 897,
`cross_room` 907, and `none` 32,274 unchanged. Seven adoptions have a self-discovery flag; one was
previously explicit. 227 named edges exceed 72 h and remain explicit, with the age warning.
The one downgrade is the issue's development example: source chat
`ac7f7c2c-fb29-42f8-a51d-3374f94f9723`, adopter turn
`43749844-9aac-4bf2-b6d0-fd93958a263b` (46.8 h). This is a narrow guard, not a measured solution to
all named-versus-received ambiguity. There are not five or ten final flipped examples to supply.

Private outputs: `/data/trace_v7_codex17`; v6 was SHA-256 checked against `/data/trace` and preserved
at `/data/trace_v6`. The six unchanged intermediate Parquets were reused; scored edges and artifact
summaries were rebuilt in 17 s with a separate DuckDB database. The dashboard's current output directory
was not replaced. Reproduction: run the updated tracer into a fresh output directory (set module `OUT`
and `DB` before `main()`; optionally reuse the six intermediate Parquets from v6), then run
`python explorer/compare_self_discovery.py --before /data/trace_v6 --after <new-output-dir>`.
The comparison writes all transitions, row-ID checks, cue counts, and a seeded blind sample plus separate
key. Seed 20261001 yields the sole changed edge plus 25 unchanged explicit controls. The changed case
is already known from development and must not be reported as held-out validation.

## Results

### Tracer v2 — source = most recent prior chat poster (sample seed 3, 2026-09-26)

| evidence | n | yes | plausible | no | unclear | precision strict | lenient |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| explicit | 25 | 18 | 5 | 0 | 2 | 78% (18/23) | 100% (23/23) |
| temporal | 25 | 8 | 11 | 3 | 3 | 36% (8/22) | 86% (19/22) |
| none | 15 | 0 | – | 9 | 6 | misses: 0/9 | |

All 3 `no` labels were **misattributions**: the adopter's text credits a different agent that had also posted
the URL earlier, but v2 picked the *most recent* poster. → v3 picks, among all prior posters, the most recent
one the adopter names; otherwise the most recent poster.

### Tracer v3 — named poster preferred (held-out sample seed 777, 2026-09-26)

Fresh sample (0 overlap with seed 3), labelled blind by **two** annotators (A = the v2 annotator, B = new).

| evidence | annotator | yes | plausible | no | unclear | precision strict | lenient |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| explicit | A | 15 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 60% [41–77%] | 100% [87–100%] |
| explicit | B | 14 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 56% [37–73%] | 100% [87–100%] |
| temporal | A | 10 | 15 | 0 | 0 | 40% [23–59%] | 100% [87–100%] |
| temporal | B | 8 | 17 | 0 | 0 | 32% [17–52%] | 100% [87–100%] |
| none (misses) | A / B | 0 / 0 | – | 10 / 12 | 5 / 3 | misses 0/10 [0–28%] · 0/12 [0–24%] | |

**Agreement A vs B:** 58/65 exact (89%), Cohen's κ = 0.84; on the 50 sourced items the lenient
"correct?" call agrees 50/50. Disagreements are yes↔plausible (3) and no↔unclear (4) — never correct↔wrong.

### Summary

- v3 removed the only failure mode seen: **0 wrong edges in 50 held-out sourced edges under both annotators**
  (v2: 3/44). Sourced edges are right-or-plausible essentially always (lenient ≥ 87% lower CI bound).
- **Strict** precision — the edge text *shows* the exposure — is ~56–60% for `explicit` and ~32–40% for
  `temporal` on held-out data. v2's 78% came from a friendlier sample (same annotator A: 78% → 60%).
- `none` edges: no confirmed missed exposure in 22 decided held-out items (upper CI ≈ 24–28%).
- Treat `temporal` as "consistent with exposure", not proof; `explicit` as the adopter naming the source.

### `mention` evidence (v4, 72 h window) — sample seed 4242, annotator A

| n | yes | plausible | no | unclear | strict | lenient | wrong |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 25 | 5 | 12 | 6 | 2 | 22% [10–42%] | 74% [54–87%] | 26% [13–46%] |

Much weaker than URL-post edges (0/50 wrong). Failure patterns: long lags (3 of 6 wrong edges at 177–1,753 min,
all 5 `yes` under 2 min); URL fragments that are not URLs (`https://daily-signal-garden` inside a regex); the
adopter's own repo coinciding with a name someone else mentioned. → v5: mention window 60 min, dotless hosts
flagged as noise. Because these changes were chosen on this sample, v5 is re-measured on a **fresh** sample below.

### `mention` evidence (v5, 60 min window, dotless hosts = noise) — fresh sample seed 9090, annotator B

| n | yes | plausible | no | unclear | strict | lenient | wrong |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 25 | 6 | 13 | 5 | 1 | 25% [12–45%] | 79% [60–91%] | 21% [9–40%] |

The tightening did not measurably help (26% → 21% wrong; CIs overlap; different annotator). Remaining errors
are structural to name matching: generic filenames shared across sites (`agent-card.json`,
`quarter-life-crisis.html`), a domain treated as a name (`o3-ux.github.io`), and adopters who got the URL
elsewhere (own machine, a GitHub issue). **Decision:** keep `mention` as a separate low-confidence level
(~1 in 5 wrong), excluded from headline numbers. Not tuned further: excluding filename/domain slugs would fix
3/5 here, but that is tuning on this sample again for a level covering < 5% of edges — future work, with a
fresh sample.

## Claim vs. screen — do "it's live / sent / published" claims match the agent's last screen? (2026-10-01)

**Why.** In Finding 1, a coordinator's checklist called the content ready while its own output showed a 59-byte
placeholder (see `docs/FINDINGS.md`, *Screenshot evidence*). How often can a completion claim be checked against
the agent's screen, and what does the check show? Measured on a seeded sample.

**Method.** `explorer/claims.py 11 60` draws a seeded uniform sample of 60 chat messages matching a
completion-claim pattern (`is live`, `successfully published`, `has been sent`, … — 8,991 such messages up to
2026-08-21, 7,882 with a non-bash computer-use turn by the same agent in the 10 min before). For each, it extracts
the latest available eligible screenshot (see *Limits*). 45 / 60 had one in the image export (the rest: turns
without a stored image). Two independent Claude annotators, **blind to the model**, labelled each pair
`supported / contradicted / unrelated / unclear` (strict: *supported* needs visible evidence on that screenshot).

| | A | B |
|---|---:|---:|
| supported | 14 | 14 |
| contradicted | 0 | 0 |
| unrelated | 22 | 23 |
| unclear | 9 | 8 |

Agreement 40/45, Cohen's κ = 0.82. Both annotators call 13 / 45 **checkable** (supported or contradicted).

**Result.**
- **13 of 45** pairs are checkable by **both** annotators (each called 14 `supported`; the intersection is 13), and
  all 13 are `supported`: **0 / 13 contradicted** (Wilson 95% [0, 22.8%]). Where the screen showed the claimed
  thing, it showed it done: Substack "Your post is live!", a just-posted X post, a Netlify site marked published.
- **Most claims can't be judged this way.** 13/45 = 29% [17.7–43.4%] of image-bearing pairs, or 13/60 = 21.7% of
  the draw. The image is usually something else: an empty terminal, a mail splash, a research page, or a draft in
  an editor while the message says the page is "LIVE".

**Reading.** No contradictions were labelled among the mutually checkable pairs, and most sampled claims cannot be
adjudicated from this one image. This does **not** show that contradictions are rare overall. The unjudgeable 71%
could hide them, and the intervals are descriptive (several claims come from the same agents; two share one
image). Finding 1's case was found by following a cascade, not from this sample. Checking the rest needs the
artifact itself or the agent's tool output, as in Finding 1 and Finding 2.

**Limits.** The frame is *eligible* posts (a non-bash, non-redacted turn by the same agent ≤ 10 min before), not
all completion claims; the 15 draws without an image are not known to be missing at random. The image is the
**latest available eligible image in the newest candidate's day tar**, not necessarily the last screen the agent
saw (33/45 fell back to an older turn; 44 distinct images for 45 claims). n = 45, one seed, model-made labels.
Hiding the model field does not guarantee blinding, because text or screens can reveal the agent. The claim
regex is English-only and built around publishing verbs. Reproduced independently by Codex (PR #20 review):
8,991 matching posts, 7,882 eligible, the same 60 draws, 45 pairs, κ 0.82. Label files, instructions and
aggregation code are on the box (`/data/findings/claims/labels/`), off git because they paraphrase dataset content.
